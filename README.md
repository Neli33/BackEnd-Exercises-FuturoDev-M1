## Repository Description:

This repository contains exercises from Module 1 of the Back End course at Futuro Dev.

### About the Course:
Futuro Dev is a comprehensive web development program designed to equip beginners with essential skills and knowledge in full-stack development. In Module 1, we focus on Back End development fundamentals, covering topics such as Java, SQL, and Spring.

### Contents:
In this repository, you will find a collection of exercises that I completed during Module 1 of the Back End course. These exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts and techniques learned in the course, including:

- Introduction to Java (installation, basic syntax, compilation, and execution)
- Flow Control Structures (conditional statements, loops)
- Arrays and ArrayLists
- Code Documentation
- Object-Oriented Programming Concepts (classes, objects, methods, attributes, constructors, modifiers, encapsulation, and method overloading)
- Java + Version Control (Git and GitHub)
- SQL (installation, configuration, DDL, DML, relational model)
- Spring (Java Servlets, Spring Boot, Spring Core, dependency injection, CRUD REST API)

Each exercise is contained within its own folder, and you can explore the code, try it out, and even contribute improvements if you'd like!

### How to Use This Repository:
- Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
- Navigate to the specific exercise folder you want to explore.
- Follow the instructions in the exercise files to complete the tasks.
- Feel free to experiment, modify, and enhance the code as you learn.
