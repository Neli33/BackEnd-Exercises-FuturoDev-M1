package exercises_week2.Ex2;

public class Ex2 {
    /*Exercise 2 - Private visibility

    Considering that I have the programs from the images 1 and 2 below:

Image 1. Class "Usuario" (User)
public String firstName;
public String lastName;
private boolean isLoggedIn;

Image 2. Class "Main" (here, there is a method to access the previous ones)

The property "isLoggedIn" has been defined as private in the "Usuario" class. What are the consequences of attempting to access this property in the "Main" class?

ANSWER:

We will not have access to the property in the "Main" class. When it is defined as private, we can only access it within the same class or in the same file.*/
